# webgl-markdown-portfolio

This repo contains a static website created in Angular
with a basic 3D renderer using **WebGL** as a portfolio
to my projects. Blog posts will be automatically generated
from markdown using templates via a **Rust** program [here](https://github.com/San7o/rust-ag-blog).

The project is currently in early development.

## usage
Serve:
```bash
npx ng serve

```
